# Rocket Program

Rocket is a program that allows anyone to create a token on solana for just a couple dollars as a fair launch. Liquidity is seeded using a bonding curve.

As more tokens are bought the price increases, and once all the tokens have been sold the reserved tokens and some of the raised funds are used to create a liquidity pool on raydium.
